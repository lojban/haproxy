# haproxy needs to listen on port 80 and port 443.  I considered
# several different ways of handling this.  Each has advantages and
# disadvantages.
#
# For some details on podman flags see
# https://github.com/rootless-containers/slirp4netns/issues/250
#
# 1.  Listen on a high port, use iptables.
#
# The config here is 
#
#        pod_args='-p 2628:2628 -p 19280:19280 -p 19243:19243 --network slirp4netns:port_handler=slirp4netns'
#
# , and in iptables is:
#
# sudo iptables -I PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 19280
# sudo iptables -I PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 19243
#
# I don't like this because it means lsof is telling lies.
#
# 2.  Use a rootfull pod and listen on 80 and 443.
#
# The config here is:
#
#       pod_args='-p 2628:2628 -p 80:19280 -p 443:19243'
#       CONTAINER_BIN='sudo /usr/bin/podman'
#
# I don't like this because rootful pods have vast magical powers.
#
# 3.  Allow anybody to open low ports.
#
# The config here is:
#
#       pod_args='-p 2628:2628 -p 80:19280 -p 443:19243 --network slirp4netns:port_handler=slirp4netns'
#
# , and then you also have to run:
#
#       # echo 80 > cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_unprivileged_port_start
#
# I don't like this because it gives out global privs, but SELinux
# won't let us open low ports normally regardless, so it's not
# *that* big a deal, although because we allow our podman users to
# run unconfined, this means any podman container can run low ports.
#
# I chose #3; it seems least surprising.  I guess.
#
# Also, it means that the logs for haproxy show up in "journalctl --user -f",
# which is there logs show up for every other container, so that's nice.
#
# The puppet code supporting it is in base/manifests/init.pp

# The other interesting part here is outbound_addr=192.168.123.119 ;
# see the smtp_backupnd definition in the conf file for how that works.
#
# The MTU thing is
